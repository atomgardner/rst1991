MODULE rst1991 implements 'the C system', a causal unicast protocol, described
in

        Michel Raynal, Andre Schiper, and Sam Toueg.
        The causal ordering abstraction and a simple way to implement it.
        Information Processing Letters, 39(6):343â€“350, September 1991.

We also show & repair a weakness in the protocol (puzzled out in discussions
with Lindsey Kuper): if a process delivers a self-addressed message, the process
eventually becomes unable to deliver messages. You can generate a run exhibiting
this defect (specified here as a DeliveryOK invariant violation) by deleting
"Fixed" on line 113, and running something like:

	java -jar /usr/share/java/tla-toolbox/tla2tools.jar \
		-config config.cfg \
		rst1991.tla
